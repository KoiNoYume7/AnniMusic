Welcome to **AnniMusic** – a self-hosted, Spotify-synced music vault made for true music lovers who are sick of losing their favorite tracks to licensing black holes. AnniMusic is your own private music webapp, built to sync your Spotify favorites and download them locally — strictly for personal use only.

## 💡 What It Does

- 🔁 **Real-Time Sync**: Continuously syncs liked songs, playlists, artists, and playback status using the Spotify API.
- 🎶 **Local Downloads**: Downloads songs using `spotDL` and stores them locally on your private server.
- 📦 **Metadata-Rich Library**: Keeps track of full song metadata (artist, album art, duration, etc.) for rich playback experience.
- 🕹️ **Playback Control**: Handles play, pause, skip, shuffle, loop, etc. – either through Spotify or your own interface.
- 📉 **Desync Prevention**: Tracks song progress to avoid playback misalignment between Spotify and your local player.
- 📁 **Offline Listening**: Download songs from your private server to your phone for offline access.
- 🏷️ **Custom Tags & Sorting**: Add your own tags to organize songs by mood, vibe, or absolute banger level.
- 📊 **Custom Wrapped**: Create your own "Spotify Wrapped" with way more detail and full control.
- 🛡️ **Private & Secure**: No user data shared. Hosted by you, for you.

## 🚀 Who It's For

- People who want to **preserve their favorite songs**, even if Spotify removes them.
- Techies who are fine hosting a private server on their **PC, laptop, or Raspberry Pi**.
- Users who want a **custom, open-ish** music experience without losing Spotify benefits.
- Friends who want to **run their own copies** of the software (you host your own = no copyright drama).

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

AnniMusic is for **personal use only**. You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with local laws and Spotify’s terms of service. No music is shared publicly or between users. The tool does not bypass DRM or distribute copyrighted material.

## 🧰 Planned Stack (Subject to Change)

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **Sync & Logic**: spotDL, yt-dlp, Spotify Web API
- **Frontend**: HTML + JS (React or vanilla JS for MVP)
- **Server**: Localhost or LAN-accessible with optional VPN
